# SDET for Hire
###Senior SDET, Automator, Tutor
# About
In 1992 I started out coding C and C++ device-drivers at a small company developing an industrial control system, based in Johannesburg. I emigrated to the UK in 2006 landing a QA job at Symbian mobile which switched me into a tester, quickly learning about USB, Bluetooth and GSM. When Symbian wound down in 2008, I moved to Clearcom, testing a digital-audio and Voip solution on micro-linux. Joined Citrix in 2010, in a virtual desktop/remote-desktop testing role mainly Windows with some Linux work. Joined DisplayLink in 2018; once again covering desktop testing but with an embedded display-docking station, for a short contract filler. I worked at Arm in the IOT division over 2019, eventually favouring a shorter commute to work at another smaller Cambridge origin company, RealVNC.

I have worked as an SDET in Cambridge for 18 years now, and am a settled UK dual-national. Making over 32 years experience developing software, most of those in mission critical systems.

# Key Skills
The nature of my first job in a manufacturing control-system environment where people rely on your code to run 24/7/365, has taught me how simplicity and discipline directly affect defect-rate. I love to automate all things infrastructure and quality related. I’m also a troubleshooter and mentor, and love to capture team knowledge to share.
- I have designed, built and then maintained CI/CD where there previously was none, and in a variety of tough environments
- Learning to take on variety of Dev-OPS tasks
- Continuous Integration test Framework creation on Desktop and various hardware platforms
-  Jenkins, Teamcity, Cruise Control. And AWS/Azure Experience
- Familiar with the Atlassian products and the Zephyr TCMS
- Tools like Perforce and Git, with CPPUnit, NUnit and custom test tool-chains and pytest
-  Python lover and lately refreshing my BASH-scripting
-  Have coding experience on Symbian O/S, Arduino, micro-Linux. Covering C/C++, Java, through C# .NET, VB scripting and even Cobol and x86 assembly
-  A can-do trouble-shooter good at researching & knowledge transfer

- I added a full Selenium integration to our Python-based test stack to support Browser tests as well as Appium for Android and iOS mobile app tests.
- Adopted/championed use of Zephyr plugin for Jira to use as TCMS.
- On the API and Cloud side of things I added Mobile Device Management (MDM) testing to our suites using Microsoft Intune, to deploy app configurations.
- Python, git. Some C++, groovy, java

## Arm July 2018 - June 2019
- Joined the arm IOT system division to help design and implement system tests.
- This is an embedded testing role using Jenkins, Github, some amazon Cloud integration.

## Early Studies
- 1991: I trained in formal software development, with a full-time COBOL and Data-Processing concepts course at the well known Van Zyl and Pritchard institution, Johannesburg.
- 1989-1990: Military service: Kept myself busy with basic radio maintenance working in the signal corps. Got hooked on programming after using a base admin computer at night to write a ration-ordering prediction program in Pascal.
- 1988-1989:  Electrical Engineering Light Current at the Cape Town Technicon (equivalent to a polytechnic).
- 1987: High school final year, taught myself 8086(Intel) MASM, and Borland ‘C’.  I then helped write parts of a data-capture application for DOS.


# Hobbies
- While at school I self-designed and built a Switched Mode 15A voltage regulator, without a kit on vero. At the same time I learned to program in C and in x86 assembly.
- I've dabbled in electronics coding ever since and still build tiny Arduino gadgets. 
- Campanologist, and a bad singer, I also own and operate a chainsaw.
- I really like RPG PC games. I also read Sci-Fi and Fantasy books made of dead trees.
